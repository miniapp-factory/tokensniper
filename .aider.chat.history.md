App Name: TokenSniper

Description / Functions (paste this into Mini App Factory):

TokenSniper is a simple and fast mini app that scans newly created tokens on the Base network.
The app helps users discover fresh token launches and evaluate basic risk indicators before interacting with them.

Core Features:
 1. New Token Feed
 • Displays a list of tokens that were recently deployed on Base.
 • Shows deployment time and contract creation details.
 2. Basic Token Info
 • For each token, display:
• Total supply
• Contract creator
• Deployment timestamp
• Basic metadata (if available)
 3. Risk Assessment
 • Provide a simple risk evaluation: Low / Medium / High.
 • Base this assessment on factors like:
• Liquidity presence
• Contract age
• Is ownership renounced
• Any suspicious patterns
 4. User Tips
 • Offer safety advice for new tokens:
• “Always verify liquidity lock.”
• “Check if the contract owner still holds too many tokens.”
• “Avoid tokens with extremely low liquidity.”
 5. Simple Query Mode
 • Users can request more details about any token from the list.
 • Example: “Tell me more about Token #3.”

Purpose:
TokenSniper helps users quickly identify new tokens, understand basic risks, and avoid obvious scams on the Base network.

Style:
Clear, concise, helpful, beginner-friendly.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this new file to describe the logo image that should be generated.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need to create a new file for the logo description. Please add the following file to the chat:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once that file is added, I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for updating `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and creating the logo description.
